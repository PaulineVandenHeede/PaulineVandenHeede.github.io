                        Producing an image that simulates the effect of global illumination with a relative small amount of noise is a difficult task when it comes to having relatively short render times.
                        It states the need for knowing the effectiveness of variance reduction techniques. These techniques try to reduce the noise in the image without having to increase the amount of samples the rendering algorithm needs to produce an image with relatively little noise.
                        The technique that will be used for the rendering algorithm is a combination of the Monte Carlo integration and path tracing. Then the variance reduction techniques, stratified and importance sampling, will be introduced.

                <h3>The research process</h3>
                <p>
                    For half a year, I had the opportunity to choose my own research project.
                    As my first love in the game industry is graphics programming; I knew I wanted to do something in this topic, and what intrigued me most about all topics was global illumination. 
                    Very early on in my research I already had the idea of going towards the direction of offline rendering rather than real time, as this was something I never did before.
                    With this decision my research became more oriented towards path tracing as this is a commen way to simulate global illumination in an image in a relative easy way.
                    <br />
                    The path tracer is a rendering algorithm that tries to solve the rendering equation by tracing paths through the scene.
                    With this concept it is fairly easy to see that indirect lighting will be accounted for as we bounce around an finite times in the scene.
                    <br />

                <h3>Approach</h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                    The experiments together with the results that were reproduced shows that the variance reduction techniques are indeed efficient ways to reduce noise in a rendered image. 
                    It can even be said that these techniques are not only more efficient in reducing the noise, but also more efficient in time.
