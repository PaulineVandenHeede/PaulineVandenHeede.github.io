                        Abstract
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Producing an image that simulates the effect of global illumination with a relative small amount of noise is a difficult task when it comes to having relatively short render times. 
                        It states the need for knowing the effectiveness of variance reduction techniques. 
                        Variance reduction techniques try to reduce the noise in the image without having to increase the amount of samples the rendering algorithm needs to produce an image. 
                        The technique that will be used for the rendering algorithm is a combination of the Monte Carlo integration and path tracing. 
                        Then the variance reduction techniques, stratified and importance sampling, will be introduced. 
                        At the end it will be proven that these variance reduction techniques are effective in rendering images with less noise without needing extra samples and with a similar render time.

                <h3>The research process</h3>
                <p>
                    For half a year, I had the opportunity to do my own research project. 
                    As my first love in the game industry is graphics programming, I knew I wanted to do something on this topic. 
                    What intrigued me most out of all the topics, was global illumination. 
                    Very early on in my research I already had the idea of going in the direction of offline rendering, rather than real time rendering, because it was something I had never done before. 
                    With this decision, my research became more oriented towards path tracing, as this is a commen way to simulate global illumination in an image in a relatively easy way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The path tracer is a rendering algorithm that tries to solve the rendering equation by tracing paths through the scene. 
                    With this concept it is fairly easy to see that indirect lighting will be accounted for as we bounce around an finite number of times in the scene.
                    <br />
                    The way this rendering algorithm solves the rendering equation is by an estimation, as the solution is an endless recursive function. 
                    Because we need this estimation, we need an understanding of basic statistics and probability theory. My understanding of these topics were very limited when starting my research, which defined another layer of the project. 
                    As it is preferred to have a result that is correct on average, I implemented the Monte Carlo integration technique.
                    <br />
                    Also, a good research question isn't based on a yes or no question, so I needed to find something that I wanted to compare and contrast. 
                    During my research of the Monte Carlo integration, there was a certain topic that was always discussed: the noise in an image. 
                    After further research, I was able to make the connection between variance reduction techniques and the noise in an image, as the first tries to solve the second in the best way possible. 
                    This then results in an image with minimal noise production.
                    <br />
                    The goal of this research was to compare these variance reduction techniques to how effective these techniques were. 
                    This has been tested by benchmarking the variance reduction techniques and by calculating image quality metrics. 
                    I was able to conclude that we can indeed see that these variance reduction techniques were effective in both generated noise and in time.
                </p>
                <h3>Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    Yielding images that are physically plausible and visually pleasing wiht respect to global illumination is the ultimate goal of this research.
                    To understand everything that is needed to generate an image like this, we need to take a deeper dive into the concepts of light and the techniques behind the rendering algorihm.
                    For this I would like to refer to my detailed paper about this topic. In this paper the folling topics will be discussed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A model for capturing light to be able to display it on an image.</li>
                        <li>a model for materials with which light interacts.</li>
                        <li>A model to capture the objects in the scene.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As my paper had a lot of mathematical formulas I used the latex editor overleaf to write it.
                </p>
                <h4>Sampling</h4>
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                    The experiments together with the results that were reproduced shows that the variance reduction techniques are indeed efficient ways to reduce noise in a rendered image. 
                    It can even be said that these techniques are not only more efficient in reducing the noise, but also more efficient in time.
